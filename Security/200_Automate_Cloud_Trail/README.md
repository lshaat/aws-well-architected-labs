# Level 200: Automated Cloud Trail

## Introduction
This hands-on lab will guide you through how to ensure that Cloud Trail is always on and automate an action using Lambda and CLoudWatch rules to turn it on automatically if it's turned off.
You will use the AWS Management Console and to guide you through how to build te components. The skills you learn will help you secure your workloads in alignment with the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).

## Goals:
* Implement detective controls
* Automate security best practices

## Prerequisites:
* An [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) that you are able to use for testing, that is not used for production or other purposes.  
NOTE: You will be billed for any applicable AWS resources used if you complete this lab that are not covered in the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
